- From The Art of Strategy by Avinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff
- Guess the number that I picked, an integer between 1 and 100. After each of your guesses, I’ll tell you if the number you guessed is higher or lower than the number I picked. Game would start with \$100 prize money and reduce \$20 for each wrong guess. So \$100 for first guess, \$80 for second, etc etc.
- Two players in this game:
	- Picker
		- Strategy is fully characterized by a one dimensional distribution of the hidden number. This would be 100 numbers
	- Guesser
