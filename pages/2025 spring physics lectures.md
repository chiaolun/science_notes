- Topics
	- [Newton's Laws of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)
		- A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

	- What happens during a collision between two objects?
		- ((67734f35-aa88-42fb-96ea-69aeb737b833))
		- One object pushes on another object with a force that increases as they get closer.
