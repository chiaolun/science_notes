	- Stellar stability puzzle
		- Here’s a fun puzzle. The fusion process inside the sun has a T^4 temperature dependence. A positive fluctuation in the temperature would thus cause the rate of fusion to go up. This would in turn cause an increase in the heat production. Why doesn’t this then cause the temperature to go up more and the feedback loop to run away and the sun to flash through all its hydrogen in an instant, monstrous explosion?
	- It's because stars have negative heat capacities! They get cooler the more energy you add to them. You can show this using the virial theorem.
