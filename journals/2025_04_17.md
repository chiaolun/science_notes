		- The fusion process inside the sun has a T^4 temperature dependence. A positive fluctuation in the temperature would thus cause the rate of fusion to go up. This would in turn cause an increase in the heat production. Why doesn’t this then cause the temperature to go up more and the feedback loop to run away and the sun to flash through all its hydrogen in an instant, monstrous explosion?
		- It's because stars have negative heat capacities! They get cooler the more energy you add to them. You can show this using the virial theorem.

				- Less energetic orbits are faster because forces are larger lower in the potential well
				- This is unlike the spring constant we usually assume

	- Torpedo Bats
		- What does a baseball bat do? What does a bludgeoning weapon do?
		- [Background: A Deep Dive Into Torpedo Bats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgeOXKb1jC0)
			- The Yankees are experimenting with a new baseball bat design to improve their offensive performance [00:06].
			- The design features a thicker barrel closer to the label and a thinner tip, deviating from the traditional bat mold [00:15].
			- Aaron Leanhardt, a former Yankees analyst, was the mastermind behind this bat design [00:54].
			- The goal was to help players make better contact, especially on inside pitches, by increasing the sweet spot near the label [01:06].
			- Five Yankees players, Anthony Volpi, Cody Bellinger, Austin Wells, Jazz Chisum, and Paul Goldmid, are using the new bat [02:34].
			- Early data suggests improved bat speed for most of these players [03:56].
			- The thinner tip may also help generate more foul balls [04:25].
			- A study indicates that optimal bat diameter for exit velocity is around 2.625 inches [05:31].
			- The new bat design may not be suitable for all players, as individual swing styles vary [07:16].
			- The design remains legal under MLB regulations, which only specify maximum bat diameter [08:22].

			- Impact speed
				- Consider this explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if7Lp3gdh_k&t=188s
				- Rolling without slipping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqp0L8Zt69g
				- What's missing in the explanation? What other changes would make sense given the explanation, but are not being done?
			- Sweet Spot
				- [Degrees of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics))
					- N particles have 3N degrees of freedom
					- If they are bound to each other, there are
						- 3 translational DOF
						- 3 rotational DOF
						- 3N - 6 vibrational DOF
					- Each DOF has an effective mass, something that resists acceleration when pushed
						- Translational mass is the same in all 3 directions
						- Rotational Intertia can differ
							- [[Tennis racket theorem]]
						- Vibrational degrees of freedom have a different mass for every DOF
