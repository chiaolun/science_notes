		  This video is about building a vortex tube. A vortex tube is a device that separates compressed air into two streams: a hot stream and a cold stream. The video starts with an introduction to vortex tubes and their history. Then, the video shows the process of building a vortex tube from scratch. The builder uses various tools and techniques, such as a lathe, a drill press, and welding. The video also discusses the theory behind how vortex tubes work, including the concept of swirling air and the formation of two vortices. Finally, the video shows the results of the build, including temperature measurements of the hot and cold streams. The builder concludes by expressing some uncertainty about the optimal design parameters for vortex tubes and the potential for further improvement.
