  The video is about the equivalence between geometrical structures and entropy. The speaker explains that the geometry of state spaces in both classical and quantum mechanics is connected to entropy. In classical mechanics, the simplec form, which quantifies the number of configurations, is used to calculate entropy. In quantum mechanics, the inner product, which gives the probability of a measurement, is used to calculate entropy. The speaker also discusses how the geometry of spacetime is related to the geometry of states.
