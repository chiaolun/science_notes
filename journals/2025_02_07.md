- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis_viva
	- The Wikipedia page titled "Vis viva" is about a historical scientific concept related to the conservation of energy, specifically kinetic energy, used in the 17th and 18th centuries. "Vis viva" translates to "living force" in Latin. It was an early attempt to understand and quantify the energy of motion.
	- The concept, primarily formulated by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, proposed that the measure of motion for a body was proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity (mvÂ²). This idea was an important step toward the modern understanding of kinetic energy, which is expressed as \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).
	- The vis viva principle was eventually absorbed into the broader law of conservation of energy as physics evolved. The historical debate around vis viva helped stimulate further investigation into dynamics and energy, leading to the refined concepts used in classical mechanics today. The Wikipedia page likely covers its historical context, key figures involved, and its evolution into contemporary energy concepts.
