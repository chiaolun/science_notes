			- You are paid the number that comes up on a dice roll. You are allowed to retry up to two times. How do you decide when to stop?
			- You have 52 playing cards (26 red, 26 black). You draw cards one by one. A red card pays you a dollar. A black one fines you a dollar. You can stop any time you want. Cards are not returned to the deck after being drawn. What is the optimal stopping rule in terms of maximizing expected payoff? Also, what is the expected payoff following this optimal rule?

			- Scope of the post – a long, theory‑heavy primer that walks absolute beginners through how Tesla coils work, then zooms in on the ultra‑simple Slayer Exciter variant before ending with practical build and troubleshooting notes.
			- Tesla‑coil fundamentals in plain language – explains resonance with everyday analogies (e.g., pushing a swing), details the roles of primary vs. secondary coils, spark‑gap vs. solid‑state drivers, and why the two coils must be “tuned” to the same resonant frequency for efficient energy transfer.
			- Why Slayer Exciters are popular – the circuit “self‑tunes,” so there’s no tedious coil‑matching math; you need only an NPN transistor, one resistor, an LED (or diode) and a few turns of primary wire around the secondary. Great first project because it lights fluorescent tubes immediately with almost no adjustment.
			- How the Slayer circuit works (high‑level)
				- Resistor biases the transistor’s base to start conduction.
				- A burst of current through the 3‑turn primary creates a magnetic field that launches electrons up the secondary.
				- The rising secondary voltage steals current from the transistor’s base, shutting it off, the field collapses, and electrons race back down – restarting the cycle.
				- The feedback happens automatically at the secondary’s natural frequency, so the system stays in resonance without external tuning.
			- Strengths – almost “plug‑and‑play,” parts are inexpensive, teaches resonance concepts without complex math or test gear, and safe voltages (9–12 V) if you keep the coil small. 
			  Instructables
			- Weaknesses that limit scaling
				- Very small spark length; looks underwhelming once you enlarge the coil.
				- Transistor overheats quickly when you push for brighter bulbs or bigger coils.
				- Author ultimately switched to a custom SSTC driver for higher power and continuous duty.
			- Key troubleshooting advice
				- LED/diode orientation – it is intentionally “backwards” compared with normal circuits; get it wrong and nothing oscillates.
				- Wind primary and secondary in opposite directions to preserve the correct feedback phase.
				- If the LED never lights, add more primary turns or tidy up a sloppy secondary to help the circuit find resonance.
				- PNP transistors can work if inserted mirror‑image, but NPN parts are simpler. 
				  Instructables
			- Bottom line – use a Slayer Exciter when you want the fastest, cheapest taste of Tesla‑coil magic; switch to more sophisticated SSTC or spark‑gap designs when you need big arcs or continuous power.
