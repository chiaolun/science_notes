  This video is about constrained Lagrangian mechanics. The video starts with the definition of action and Hamilton's principle. Then, the video derives the Euler-Lagrange equations and incorporates constraints to modify the equations. Finally, the video provides a physical interpretation of the results and tries to get some intuition as to what the equations of motion actually mean. The video also includes a couple of examples of constraints that can be cast into this holonomic form.
