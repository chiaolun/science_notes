  This video is about constrained Lagrangian mechanics. The video starts with the definition of action and Hamilton's principle. Then, the video derives the Euler-Lagrange equations and incorporates constraints to modify the equations. Finally, the video provides a physical interpretation of the results and tries to get some intuition as to what the equations of motion actually mean. The video also includes a couple of examples of constraints that can be cast into this holonomic form.

  This video is about the intermediate axis theorem, which states that a rigid body rotating about its center of mass will be stable when rotating about its principal axes of maximum or minimum moment of inertia, but unstable when rotating about its intermediate principal axis. The video starts by introducing the concept of moment of inertia and how it relates to the stability of rotation. Then, it derives Euler's equations of motion for a rigid body and uses them to explain the intermediate axis theorem. Finally, the video provides a simulation to visualize the theorem in action.

  This video is about Lagrange multipliers, a technique used to solve constrained optimization problems. The video starts by introducing the concept of constrained optimization and how it can be visualized using contour lines. Then, the video derives the Lagrange multiplier equation, which is a necessary condition for the solution of a constrained optimization problem. Finally, the video provides a physical interpretation of the Lagrange multiplier and discusses its meaning in physical contexts.

  The Dzhanibekov effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a rigid body is rotated about its intermediate principal axis of inertia. The video explains the Dzhanibekov effect using a simple model of a rigid body consisting of four masses connected by struts. The video shows that the Dzhanibekov effect is caused by the inertia of the smaller masses, which swing outward away from the axis of rotation and toward the equatorial plane. The video also explains why rotation about the intermediate principal axis is unstable, while rotation about the other two principal axes is stable. The video concludes by showing that the Dzhanibekov effect is also present when the rotation axis is initially near the principal axis with the largest moment of inertia, but with a smaller amplitude.

  This video is about the Karatsuba algorithm, a fast multiplication algorithm. The video starts by introducing the concept of time complexity and how it is used to measure the efficiency of algorithms. Then, the video explains the naive multiplication algorithm and its time complexity of O(n^2). Next, the video introduces the Karatsuba algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm that can multiply two n-digit numbers in O(n^1.585) time. The video also explains how the Karatsuba algorithm works and why it is faster than the naive multiplication algorithm. Finally, the video discusses the implications of the Karatsuba algorithm for computer science and cryptography.
