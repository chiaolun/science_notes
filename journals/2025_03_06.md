- Chemical Equilibria

		- **Equilibrium:** A state where a system is balanced, with forward and reverse reactions occurring at the same rate. This doesn't mean the reaction is static, but rather that there's no net change in concentrations of reactants and products.
		- **Chemical Equilibrium:** Achieved when forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, resulting in no observable change in concentration. Chemists often try to manipulate equilibrium to maximize product formation.
		- **Le Chatelier's Principle:** Describes how changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure can disrupt equilibrium.
		- **Concentration:** Adding reactants shifts the equilibrium towards product formation, and vice versa.
		- **Pressure:** Increased pressure favors the side with fewer gas moles, while decreased pressure favors the side with more gas moles.
		- **Temperature:** Higher temperatures favor endothermic reactions (heat-absorbing), and lower temperatures favor exothermic reactions (heat-releasing).
		- **Haber Process:**  The video uses the Haber process for ammonia production as an example of equilibrium principles in action. However, it also notes that equilibrium is not always desirable in industrial chemistry.
		- **Dynamic Balance:** Equilibrium is not static but a dynamic balance that adapts to changing conditions.
