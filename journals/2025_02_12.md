	- The video is about the Voyager mission, which was a series of space probes launched by NASA in the 1970s to explore the outer planets of the solar system. The Voyager probes were designed to take advantage of a rare alignment of the planets that would allow them to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune on a single mission. The Voyager probes were launched in 1977 and have been exploring the solar system ever since. They are now the farthest human-made objects from Earth.
	- Here are some of the key points about the Voyager mission:
		- The Voyager mission was a series of space probes launched by NASA in the 1970s to explore the outer planets of the solar system.
		- The Voyager probes were designed to take advantage of a rare alignment of the planets that would allow them to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune on a single mission.
		  The Voyager probes were launched in 1977 and have been exploring the solar system ever since.
		- They are now the farthest human-made objects from Earth.
		- The Voyager probes have made many important discoveries about the solar system, including the discovery of moons around Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
		- The Voyager probes are still operating today and are expected to continue to do so for many years to come.
		- The Voyager mission is one of the most successful space missions in history. It has provided us with a wealth of information about the solar system and has helped us to better understand our place in the universe.

	- Oberth effect
		- The Oberth effect is a phenomenon in astrodynamics and rocket science, named after the German physicist Hermann Oberth. It describes how a spacecraft or rocket can generate more kinetic energy when it performs a propulsion maneuver at high speeds than when it is at lower speeds. This effect occurs because the rocket's engine is producing the same amount of thrust regardless of the spacecraft's speed, and when the spacecraft is moving faster, the thrust is applied over more distance per unit of time.
		- In essence, as the spacecraft's velocity increases, the kinetic energy gained from the same amount of fuel burned is greater. This makes maneuvers such as burns more efficient when they are performed at high velocities, such as when the spacecraft is at periapsis, the point in its orbit closest to the central body. This efficiency gain is critical during missions that involve complex trajectories, such as interplanetary travel, because it allows for greater velocity changes with less fuel consumption.
