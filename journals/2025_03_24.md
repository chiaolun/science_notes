		- Ionic
			- Outright transfer of an electron from one atom to another.
			- The donor becomes positively charged and is called a cation.
			- The acceptor becomes negatively charged and is called an anion.
			- For example, in NaCl (table salt), the sodium atom becomes the positively charged sodium cation, and the chloride atom becomes the negatively charged chloride anion.
			- When in solid form, cations and anions sit in a regular grid,
		- Covalent
		- Metallic
	- Carbon
		- Diamond
			- sp3 bonding
			- poor electrical conductor (5.47 eV band gap)
			- very good thermal conductor (3000 W/mK)
				- demonstration, melting ice with a diamond plate:

				- stiff material
					- thermal vibrations travel fast
					- fast diffusion of phonons / long mean free path
			- synthetic diamonds
			- structural color
		- Graphite
			- sp2 bonding
			- electrical conductivity
				- good in-plane (2000 W/mK)
					- No band gap

			- thermal conductivity
				- good in-plane
				- poor through-plane
		- Carbon Nanotubes
			- Types
				- Walls - Number of Layers
