	- The host recreates the Rutherford gold foil experiment to demonstrate that atoms are mostly empty space [00:06].
	- The experiment involves firing alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold and observing their behavior using a Geiger counter [01:16].
	- The results show that most alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil, indicating that atoms are mostly empty space [03:48].
	- Some alpha particles bounce back, revealing the existence of a tiny, dense nucleus within the atom [08:32].
	- The video also explains why alpha radiation is not dangerous externally but can be harmful if inhaled or ingested [10:24].
