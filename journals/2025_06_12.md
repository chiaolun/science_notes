			- Hat color puzzle
				- 1000 logicians standing in a circle are blindfolded and a hat of either black or white color is placed on each person's head. The blindfolds are then removed and each person can now see everybody's hat color but his own. After exactly one minute, they all have to simultaneously guess their own hat color.

			- Rainbow hats puzzle
				- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/149915/rainbow-hats-puzzle
				- Seven prisoners are given the chance to be set free tomorrow. An executioner will put a hat on each prisoner's head. Each hat can be one of the seven colors of the rainbow and the hat colors are assigned completely at the executioner's discretion. Every prisoner can see the hat colors of the other six prisoners, but not his own. They cannot communicate with others in any form, or else they are immediately executed. Then each prisoner writes down his guess of his own hat color. If at least one prisoner correctly guesses the color of his hat, they all will be set free immediately; otherwise they will be executed. They are given the night to come up with a strategy. Is there a strategy that they can guarantee that they will be set free?
