		  The video is about the history of longitude and how it was solved. The video starts by explaining the difference between latitude and longitude. Then, the video explains how latitude was easy to calculate in the 1600s, but longitude was much harder. The video then discusses the Longitude Act of 1714, which offered a prize for anyone who could solve the longitude problem. The video then discusses the work of John Harrison, who invented a series of clocks that were accurate enough to determine longitude. The video also discusses the lunar tables method, which was another method for determining longitude. The video concludes by discussing how the invention of radio and GPS made it possible to determine longitude with even greater accuracy.
