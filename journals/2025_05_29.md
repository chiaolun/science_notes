				- Scope of the post – a long, theory‑heavy primer that walks absolute beginners through how Tesla coils work, then zooms in on the ultra‑simple Slayer Exciter variant before ending with practical build and troubleshooting notes.
				- Tesla‑coil fundamentals in plain language – explains resonance with everyday analogies (e.g., pushing a swing), details the roles of primary vs. secondary coils, spark‑gap vs. solid‑state drivers, and why the two coils must be “tuned” to the same resonant frequency for efficient energy transfer.
				- Why Slayer Exciters are popular – the circuit “self‑tunes,” so there’s no tedious coil‑matching math; you need only an NPN transistor, one resistor, an LED (or diode) and a few turns of primary wire around the secondary. Great first project because it lights fluorescent tubes immediately with almost no adjustment.
				- How the Slayer circuit works (high‑level)
					- Resistor biases the transistor’s base to start conduction.
					- A burst of current through the 3‑turn primary creates a magnetic field that launches electrons up the secondary.
					- The rising secondary voltage steals current from the transistor’s base, shutting it off, the field collapses, and electrons race back down – restarting the cycle.
					- The feedback happens automatically at the secondary’s natural frequency, so the system stays in resonance without external tuning.
				- Strengths – almost “plug‑and‑play,” parts are inexpensive, teaches resonance concepts without complex math or test gear, and safe voltages (9–12 V) if you keep the coil small. 
				  Instructables
				- Weaknesses that limit scaling
					- Very small spark length; looks underwhelming once you enlarge the coil.
					- Transistor overheats quickly when you push for brighter bulbs or bigger coils.
					- Author ultimately switched to a custom SSTC driver for higher power and continuous duty.
				- Key troubleshooting advice
					- LED/diode orientation – it is intentionally “backwards” compared with normal circuits; get it wrong and nothing oscillates.
					- Wind primary and secondary in opposite directions to preserve the correct feedback phase.
					- If the LED never lights, add more primary turns or tidy up a sloppy secondary to help the circuit find resonance.
					- PNP transistors can work if inserted mirror‑image, but NPN parts are simpler. 
					  Instructables
				- Bottom line – use a Slayer Exciter when you want the fastest, cheapest taste of Tesla‑coil magic; switch to more sophisticated SSTC or spark‑gap designs when you need big arcs or continuous power.
