	- What are typical delta-v for deep space maneuvers, used by deep space missions to outer planets or for "interstellar missions" ? For example, Voyager 1 now has 17 km/s speed relative to the Sun. What part of the speed was created by the rocket, what was delta-v of its hydrazine thruster, and what was delta-v from gravitational slingshots (gravity assists)?
