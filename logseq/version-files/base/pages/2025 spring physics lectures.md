	- [Newton's Laws of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)
		- A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

	- What happens during a collision between two objects?

		- Stages of a Collision
			- Objects approach each other with some relative velocity v, each initially experiencing no net force.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- At some distance $R$, they begin to repel each other with a force that strictly increases as they get closer. The force is purely a function of the distance between the two objects.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- As they push on each other, their relative velocity goes down, until it reaches zero. At this point the two objects have the same absolute velocity as each other.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The two objects begin to accelerate away from each other, and because the force is purely a function of the distance, the two objects will eventually gain relative velocity -v, same magnitude but exactly opposite the direction of the initial relative velocity.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- At stage 3, the two objects have no velocity relative to each other, and are traveling at the same absolute velocity. We will determine that velocity from $m_1, v_1, m_2, v_2$
			- The decelerating force each object is experiencing is the same (due to the 3rd law). According the the 2nd law, the acceleration experienced is inversely proportional to the mass of each object.
