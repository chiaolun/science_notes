	- [Newton's Laws of Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)
		- A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

		- Stages of a Collision
			- Objects approach each other with some relative velocity v, each initially experiencing no net force.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- At some distance $R$, they begin to repel each other with a force that strictly increases as they get closer. The force is purely a function of the distance between the two objects.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- As they push on each other, their relative velocity goes down, until it reaches zero. At this point the two objects have the same absolute velocity as each other.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The two objects begin to accelerate away from each other, and because the force is purely a function of the distance, the two objects will eventually gain relative velocity -v, same magnitude but exactly opposite the direction of the initial relative velocity.

		- ### Conservation of Momentum
			- By the 3rd law, the decelerating force each object is experiencing is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.
			  By the 2nd law, the acceleration experienced is inversely proportional to the mass of each object. 
			  $v_1 \rightarrow v_1 + \frac{F}{m_1} \Delta t$
			  $v_2 \rightarrow v_2 - \frac{F}{m_2} \Delta t$
			- As a result, if you take the sum of products of masses by velocities, you get
			  $m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 \rightarrow m_1 (v_1 + \frac{F}{m_1} \Delta t) + m_2 (v_2 - \frac{F}{m_2} \Delta t) = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2$
			- As long as there are no external forces, the sum of $m$ multiplied by $v$ is always the same! We call this the conservation of momentum, and we've derived it as a direct consequence of Newton's Laws.
		- Using the conservation of momentum, we can find the velocity that the two objects reach in stage 3, at the moment of closest approach. We call that velocity $v_c$.
		  $m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = (m_1 + m_2)v_c$
		- We express initial velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ relative to $v_c$
		  $v_{i1} = v_c + u_1$
		  $v_{i2} = v_c + u_2$
		- The final velocities are thus
		  $v_{f1} = v_c - u_1$
		  $v_{f2} = v_c - u_2$
		- Initial kinetic energy:
		  $\frac{1}{2}m_1v_{i1} + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{i2}$
