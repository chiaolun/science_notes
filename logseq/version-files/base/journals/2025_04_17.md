	- Stellar stability puzzle
		- The fusion process inside the sun has a T^4 temperature dependence. A positive fluctuation in the temperature would thus cause the rate of fusion to go up. This would in turn cause an increase in the heat production. Why doesnâ€™t this then cause the temperature to go up more and the feedback loop to run away and the sun to flash through all its hydrogen in an instant, monstrous explosion?
		- It's because stars have negative heat capacities! They get cooler the more energy you add to them. You can show this using the virial theorem.
