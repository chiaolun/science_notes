	- Stellar stability puzzle
		- The fusion process inside the sun has a T^4 temperature dependence. A positive fluctuation in the temperature would thus cause the rate of fusion to go up. This would in turn cause an increase in the heat production. Why doesnâ€™t this then cause the temperature to go up more and the feedback loop to run away and the sun to flash through all its hydrogen in an instant, monstrous explosion?
		- It's because stars have negative heat capacities! They get cooler the more energy you add to them. You can show this using the virial theorem.

			- The Yankees are experimenting with a new baseball bat design to improve their offensive performance [00:06].
			- The design features a thicker barrel closer to the label and a thinner tip, deviating from the traditional bat mold [00:15].
			- Aaron Lenhard, a former Yankees analyst, was the mastermind behind this bat design [00:54].
			- The goal was to help players make better contact, especially on inside pitches, by increasing the sweet spot near the label [01:06].
			- Five Yankees players, Anthony Volpi, Cody Bellinger, Austin Wells, Jazz Chisum, and Paul Goldmid, are using the new bat [02:34].
			- Early data suggests improved bat speed for most of these players [03:56].
			- The thinner tip may also help generate more foul balls [04:25].
			- A study indicates that optimal bat diameter for exit velocity is around 2.625 inches [05:31].
			- The new bat design may not be suitable for all players, as individual swing styles vary [07:16].
			- The design remains legal under MLB regulations, which only specify maximum bat diameter [08:22].
