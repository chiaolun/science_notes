	- Electrochemistry and Semiconductors are related by their study of charged particles that undergo three type of processes
		- Drift under an electric field
		- Diffusion across a concentration gradient
		- Creation and annihilation upon encountering other particles

		- Redox reactions are a class of reactions that each compose of an oxidation and a reduction. The properties of a redox reaction can be predicted from those of the two half-reactions that form it.
			- Walk through the process of balancing a redox reaction, in [example 17.1](https://openstax.org/books/chemistry-2e/pages/17-1-review-of-redox-chemistry)
		- Notice how we introduced electrons but had all of them cancel out at the end. Well, you don't need to do that. Consider this reaction:
