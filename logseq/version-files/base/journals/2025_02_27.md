	- Electrochemistry and Semiconductors are related by their study of charged particles that undergo three type of processes
		- Drift under an electric field
		- Diffusion across a concentration gradient
		- Creation and annihilation upon encountering other particles
	- Redox reactions are a class of reactions that each compose of an oxidation and a reduction. The properties of a redox reaction can be predicted from those of the two half-reactions that form it.
