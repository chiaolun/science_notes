	- The video starts by defining variance as the average squared distance from the mean [00:09]. It distinguishes between population variance and sample variance, noting that calculating population variance is straightforward when the entire population is known [01:06].
	- However, when dealing with samples, complications arise because the entire population is not observed [01:44]. The video explains that using the sample mean in the variance calculation results in an underestimation of the population variance [04:03]. This is because each data point in the sample influences the sample mean, causing it to be closer to the data points than the true population mean.
	- To compensate for this underestimation and obtain an unbiased estimator of the population variance, the formula uses n-1 instead of n [05:08]. This adjustment corrects for the smaller sum of squared differences when using the sample mean [05:15]. The video concludes by emphasizing that while using n in the formula isn't fundamentally wrong, using n-1 provides an unbiased estimate of the population variance [05:50].
