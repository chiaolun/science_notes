	- Video explains the band theory of solids:
		- Introduction to Band Theory: The video introduces band theory as a refined model for bonding in metals, useful for understanding electrical and optical properties of ceramics, metals, and semiconductors [00:28]. It contrasts the model of an isolated atom with that of a solid, where many atoms are close together [02:21].
		- Formation of Energy Bands: When atoms come close together in a solid, their electron energy levels interact and split, forming multiple states [03:53]. With a large number of atoms, such as in a mole, the spacing between these states becomes so small that they appear to blend together, forming continuous bands [04:27].
		- Band Structures in Solids: The video discusses three general forms of band structures observed in solids [05:58]:
		- Copper Example: Copper, with its electron configuration, has a 4s band that is only half-filled, allowing electrons to easily move to unfilled states and conduct electricity [06:21].
		  Magnesium Example: Magnesium has a filled valence band (3s), but its 3p band overlaps with the 3s band, allowing electrons to be excited into the unfilled 3p band for conduction [11:45].
		  Insulators and Semiconductors: In these materials, there is a gap between the filled valence band and the empty conduction band, known as the band gap, which electrons must jump across to conduct [14:26].
		- Classification by Band Gap: Materials can be classified based on their band gap: semiconductors have a gap less than two electron volts, insulators have a gap more than two electron volts, and conductors have no band gap [16:16].
