			- Bouncing off a wall
				- Do you gain or lose energy when the wall is moving towards you? How do you show this?
			- Gravitational Slingshot
				- Given the planet is going at $\vec{v_p}$ and the space ship at $\vec{v}$, what is the fastest speed at which the ship can depart the planet?
			- Oberth Effect
				- Does the consumption of each kilogram of fuel result in a fixed momentum boost or a fixed energy boost to the rocket? How do you maximize the other? Is the resulting total kinetic energy at the end the same?
