			- Wave Reflection: Waves can reflect right side up from a free end [03:30] or upside down from a restrained end [03:51], a principle applicable across different wave types [04:45].
			- Superposition: Waves traveling in opposite directions combine [06:18], leading to phenomena like standing waves [07:30], resonance [08:43], and nodes [08:18].
			- Impedance: This is the ratio of cause to effect in wave generation [10:43]. Impedance matching, using a dashpot, can absorb wave energy and prevent reflection [12:33].
			- Standing Wave Ratio (SWR): SWR can calculate the percentage of wave reflection at a termination [16:05].
			- Impedance Discontinuities: Waves reflect where the transmission medium's impedance changes abruptly [19:05]. Devices like quarter-wave transformers [22:21] and tapered section transformers [24:23] minimize these reflections.

				- This video uses a high-speed camera to observe how electricity behaves in a circuit, specifically at a fork in the road. Here's a breakdown:
					- The Experiment: The video sets up a circuit with a 9-volt battery and a wire that splits into two branches [00:45]. One branch has connected wires, and the other has disconnected wires. The goal is to see how the electricity behaves when the circuit is closed.
					- Initial Guesses: The video presents four possible scenarios for how the electricity might behave [02:12].
					- High-Speed Filming: The video uses a custom setup with long wires to slow down the electricity enough to be captured by a high-speed camera [05:07].
					- Observations:
						- The initial wave of electricity travels very fast, about 2/3 the speed of light [15:08].
						- Electrons themselves move much slower than the wave [15:25].
						- When the wave hits the fork, it splits, and part of it reflects back [10:55].
						- The disconnected branch causes the wave to slam into a wall and reflect back [11:20].
						- The connected branch shorts out the pulse, which also sends information back [11:27].
						- It takes multiple reflections for the circuit to stabilize and for the current to follow Ohm's Law [12:22].
					- Water Channel Model: The video compares the behavior of electricity to water flowing through channels, showing similarities and differences [22:18].
					- Key Findings: The battery initially sends out a "guess" of how much current to send, and it takes time for the circuit to communicate and adjust to the correct amount based on the circuit's properties [10:50].
					- Additional Content: The video mentions a follow-up video with a more mathematical analysis of the circuit [25:34].

				- Introduction: The video builds upon a previous video about electricity waves, showing how pulses of electricity propagate down a homemade cable [00:11].
				- Wave Propagation and Reflection: The behavior of voltage waves is demonstrated when the wire ends are connected versus disconnected [00:30]. When disconnected, the voltage bounces up upon reflection, and electron movement stops [00:35].
				- Impedance Explained: The video explains how the circuit determines the correct current flow by adjusting itself until it reaches equilibrium [01:05]. The voltage and current of the initial wave correspond to a resistance of about 150 ohms, even without a physical 150-ohm resistor in the circuit [01:35].
				- Impedance Matching: The concept of impedance matching is introduced, showing how a 150-ohm resistor at the end of the line stops signal reflection [04:38]. This magical value allows the electrons to "see" what they expect, preventing any bouncing [05:04].
				- Line Impedance as a Substitute Resistor: Line impedance is described as an imaginary resistor that simplifies Ohm's law calculations in complex circuits [06:29].
				- The Physics Behind Impedance: The video explains why a cable has a specific impedance, even though direct measurement with a multimeter doesn't show it [08:56]. It's due to the interaction of electric fields between the wires, which creates the effect of a resistor [10:35].
				- Complex Circuit Analysis: The principles are applied to a more complex Y-shaped circuit, showing how the initial pulse splits and reflects based on the impedance of the wires and the loads at the ends [13:23].
				- Equilibrium: The impedance of the line governs the strength of the initial current pulse, and subsequent reflections bring the circuit to equilibrium [16:03].
	- Puzzles
		- Optimal stopping
			- You are paid the number that comes up on a dice roll. You are allowed to retry up to two times. How do you decide when to stop?
			- You have 52 playing cards (26 red, 26 black). You draw cards one by one. A red card pays you a dollar. A black one fines you a dollar. You can stop any time you want. Cards are not returned to the deck after being drawn. What is the optimal stopping rule in terms of maximizing expected payoff? Also, what is the expected payoff following this optimal rule?
