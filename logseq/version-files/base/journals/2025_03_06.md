		- **Equilibrium:** A state where a system is balanced, with forward and reverse reactions occurring at the same rate. This doesn't mean the reaction is static, but rather that there's no net change in concentrations of reactants and products.
			- \[ \text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g) \]
				- The Haber process is represented by the following chemical equation in LaTeX:
				  
				  
				  This equation shows the synthesis of ammonia (\(\text{NH}_3\)) from nitrogen (\(\text{N}_2\)) and hydrogen (\(\text{H}_2\)) gases, using a reversible reaction arrow to indicate that the reaction can proceed in both forward and backward directions.
		- **Chemical Equilibrium:** Achieved when forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, resulting in no observable change in concentration. Chemists often try to manipulate equilibrium to maximize product formation.
		- **Le Chatelier's Principle:** Describes how changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure can disrupt equilibrium.
			- **Concentration:** Adding reactants shifts the equilibrium towards product formation, and vice versa.
			- **Pressure:** Increased pressure favors the side with fewer gas moles, while decreased pressure favors the side with more gas moles.
			- **Temperature:** Higher temperatures favor endothermic reactions (heat-absorbing), and lower temperatures favor exothermic reactions (heat-releasing).
		- **Haber Process:**  The video uses the Haber process for ammonia production as an example of equilibrium principles in action. However, it also notes that equilibrium is not always desirable in industrial chemistry.
		- **Dynamic Balance:** Equilibrium is not static but a dynamic balance that adapts to changing conditions.

			- The Three Laws of Thermodynamics are fundamental principles that describe the behavior of energy and heat in systems:
			  
			  1. **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation):** 
			     Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed or transferred. In any process, the total energy of a closed system and its surroundings remains constant. Mathematically, it is often expressed as ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy of the system, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.
			  
			  2. **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** 
			     The entropy of an isolated system always increases over time, and processes that increase entropy are irreversible. It also implies that heat naturally flows from hot objects to cold ones and not the reverse. A common statement of the second law is that no process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a cooler to a hotter body. Another formulation is that the total entropy of a system and its surroundings always increases for an irreversible process.
			  
			  3. **Third Law of Thermodynamics:** 
			     As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero. This law implies that it is impossible to reach absolute zero in a finite number of steps, as at zero kelvins, a system theoretically would have its minimum possible energy state.
			  
			  These laws provide a comprehensive framework for understanding thermodynamic processes and the limits of energy transformation.
