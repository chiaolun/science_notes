		- **Equilibrium:** A state where a system is balanced, with forward and reverse reactions occurring at the same rate. This doesn't mean the reaction is static, but rather that there's no net change in concentrations of reactants and products.
			- The Haber process is represented by the following chemical equation in LaTeX:
			  \[ \text{N}_2(g) + 3\text{H}_2(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NH}_3(g) \]
			- This equation shows the synthesis of ammonia (\(\text{NH}_3\)) from nitrogen (\(\text{N}_2\)) and hydrogen (\(\text{H}_2\)) gases, using a reversible reaction arrow to indicate that the reaction can proceed in both forward and backward directions.
		- **Chemical Equilibrium:** Achieved when forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates, resulting in no observable change in concentration. Chemists often try to manipulate equilibrium to maximize product formation.
		- **Le Chatelier's Principle:** Describes how changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure can disrupt equilibrium.
			- **Concentration:** Adding reactants shifts the equilibrium towards product formation, and vice versa.
			- **Pressure:** Increased pressure favors the side with fewer gas moles, while decreased pressure favors the side with more gas moles.
			- **Temperature:** Higher temperatures favor endothermic reactions (heat-absorbing), and lower temperatures favor exothermic reactions (heat-releasing).
		- **Haber Process:**  The video uses the Haber process for ammonia production as an example of equilibrium principles in action. However, it also notes that equilibrium is not always desirable in industrial chemistry.
		- **Dynamic Balance:** Equilibrium is not static but a dynamic balance that adapts to changing conditions.

		- Three Laws of Thermodynamics
			- Energy conservation: ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy of the system, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.

			- The entropy of an isolated system always increases over time, and processes that increase entropy are irreversible.

			- As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero.

		- Carnot Engine (1824)
			- Theoretical engine proposed by Sadi Carnot, based on knowledge of the ideal gas law. Engines are machines that convert heat into work.

				- Heat (Q) isn't a state variable - over the full cycle, net heat transfer into the engine is positive, converted to work
				- It is noticed, however, that \[ \frac{Q}{T} \] sums to zero over the whole cycle
				- \[ \Delta S = \frac{Q}{T} \] is recognized as being a state variable, entropy.
				- For a reversible cycle, the transfers happen between bodies of infinitesimally different T. Consider what happens when T is different, however. In that case, the term is \[ - \frac{Q}{T_h}\] for the heat-losing side and \[ \frac{Q}{T_c} \] for the heat-gaining side.
					- \[ Q \left( \frac{1} {T_c} - \frac{1} {T_h} \right) \gt 0 \]
					- For irreversible processes, total entropy goes up
	- Gibb's Free Energy
		- \[ \Delta S_{universe} = \Delta S_{environment} + \Delta S_{system} =  \frac{\Delta H}{T}  + \Delta S_{system} = - \frac {1} {T} \left(  \Delta H - T \Delta S \right) = -\frac{G}{T}  \]
		- G tells us when a reaction will be spontaneous. Note the environment term - negative enthalpy reactions are favored because at finite temperature, the energy lost to the environment increases its entropy.

				- More precisely, given the reaction and concentrations of the reactants and products, you can compute the reaction quotient. The reaction quotient, in turn, will change spontaneously to match the reaction constant.
