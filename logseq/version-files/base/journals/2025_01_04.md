  The video is about Lagrangian mechanics, a powerful and commonly used method in physics that replaces Newtonian mechanics at higher levels. The video starts by explaining the difference between Newtonian mechanics and Lagrangian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics describes the world with forces, while Lagrangian mechanics describes the world with energy. The video then goes on to explain how to use Lagrangian mechanics to solve problems. The video concludes by discussing the importance of Lagrangian mechanics and how it is used in modern physics.
