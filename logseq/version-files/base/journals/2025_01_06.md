  This video is about tuned mass dampers (TMDs), which are devices used to reduce the amplitude of vibration in tall buildings. The video explains how TMDs work by using a pendulum to absorb kinetic energy from the building's swaying motion. The video also discusses the history of TMDs, including the Taipei 101 Tower, which has a TMD that is open to the public. The video concludes with a demonstration of a model TMD, which shows how it can reduce the amplitude of vibration in a building.
