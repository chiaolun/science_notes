  The video is about the atomic structure and how electrons behave in an atom. The video starts with a brief discussion on the planetary model of the atom and its limitations. The narrator then introduces the concept of quantum mechanics and how it can be used to explain the behavior of electrons in an atom. The video then goes on to discuss the different types of orbitals that electrons can occupy, and how these orbitals are related to the quantum numbers that describe the energy, shape, and orientation of the electron. The video concludes with a discussion of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.
