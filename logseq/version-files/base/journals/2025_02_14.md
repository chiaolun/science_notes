  The video is about the physics of pumping a swing. It explains that the common way of pumping a swing, by moving back and forth at the ends of the swing's arc, is not a parametric oscillator, but rather a driven oscillator. This is because the swinger applies force to the swing at the ends of its motion, rather than at the lowest point. The video also shows a demonstration of a driven oscillator using a wheel and a pendulum.
