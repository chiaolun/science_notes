- [Answer to How are a diode and a transistor similar? Can a transistor simply be made from two diodes? by Jose Soares Augusto](https://www.quora.com/How-are-a-diode-and-a-transistor-similar-Can-a-transistor-simply-be-made-from-two-diodes/answer/Jose-Soares-Augusto?ch=15&oid=129012804&share=9036a255&srid=u2STH&target_type=answer)
	- For the device to have a meaningful current gain (say β>50β>50) in the active (or amplification) region, the thickness of the base must be very small, such that a large fraction (α=β/(β+1)α=β/(β+1)) of the charge carriers coming from the emitter pass through the base and reach the colector. That is impossible to occur with two packaged diodes because the common junction which “would be” the base is in reality two chunks of doped semiconductor material linked by a conductor (the back-to-back diodes’ terminals) — and not a single, thin, chunk of semiconductor material. So there is no thin base in back-to-back diodes, and there is no gain.
