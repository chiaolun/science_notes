- The Experiment That Proved Atoms Are Mostly Empty Space #[[The Action Lab]] 
  https://youtu.be/bq4su2Lp2iw
	- The host recreates the Rutherford gold foil experiment to demonstrate that atoms are mostly empty space [00:06].
	- The experiment involves firing alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold and observing their behavior using a Geiger counter [01:16].
	- The results show that most alpha particles pass straight through the gold foil, indicating that atoms are mostly empty space [03:48].
	- Some alpha particles bounce back, revealing the existence of a tiny, dense nucleus within the atom [08:32].
	- The video also explains why alpha radiation is not dangerous externally but can be harmful if inhaled or ingested [10:24].

	- Semiconductors can switch between conducting and insulating, unlike regular conductors (e.g., copper) and insulators (e.g., rubber) [01:48].
	- Transistors use electrical inputs to control electrical current, enabling interconnected networks for complex tasks [02:36].
	- Atomic Structure and Electron Behavior
	  Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons [03:29].
	- Electrons are attracted to the nucleus, with the force described by a specific formula [03:58].
	  Energy is required to move electrons away from the nucleus, increasing their potential energy [05:05].
	- Quantum Mechanics and Electron Properties
	  Electrons behave as both particles and waves, described by a wave function [08:34].
	  Electrons do not orbit the nucleus but exist in a general area related to their energy level [10:04].
	- Electrons have intrinsic angular momentum called spin, which can be up or down [10:43].
	- Electrons in an atom can only have specific energy values [11:15].
	- The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that only two electrons with opposite spins can occupy a single orbital [12:02].
	- Conductivity Explained
	  Conductivity is how easily electrons can move [12:31].
	- Free electrons are needed for electrical conduction [14:02].
	- Ionization, the process of freeing electrons, requires significant energy [13:34].
	- Molecular Orbital Theory
	  When atoms get close, their energy levels overlap [18:23].
	- The Pauli Exclusion Principle leads to energy level splitting, creating bonding and anti-bonding orbitals [19:12].
	- Bonding orbitals have lower energy, making covalent bonds stable [24:39].
	- Energy Bands and Band Gaps
	  In solids, closely spaced energy levels form continuous energy bands [25:45].
	- The highest occupied energy band determines conductivity [27:07].
	- A partially filled band allows electrons to move easily, resulting in conductivity [27:13].
	- A full band requires electrons to jump a band gap to conduct, defining insulators [27:55].
	  Semiconductors and Thermal Energy
	  Semiconductors have a small band gap [28:31].
	- Thermal energy, described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, can enable electrons to jump the gap [28:48].
	- The number of conducting electrons changes exponentially with temperature [29:24].
	  Semiconductor Devices
	- These devices control conductivity by creating an energy barrier [30:28].
	- Input voltage affects the barrier height, controlling electron flow [30:36].
	- The Fermi-Dirac equation explains the exponential relationship between voltage and current in devices like diodes and transistors [31:20].

	- Introduction to Doping: Doping is the final and most important step in semiconductor fabrication, allowing semiconductors to switch between conductor and insulator states [00:13].
	- Pure Silicon: Pure silicon has 14 electrons, forming covalent bonds. Electrons need significant energy to conduct electricity, making pure silicon an insulator [00:49].
	- Mobile Electrons and Holes: When an electron gains energy, it leaves a hole, both contributing to conduction. Voltage moves electrons and holes in opposite directions [02:11].
	- N-type Doping: Replacing silicon with phosphorus (extra electron) introduces a mobile electron, dramatically altering conductivity [04:29].
	- P-type Doping: Replacing silicon with boron (one fewer electron) creates a hole that can contribute to electrical conduction [06:30].
	- Dopants: Dopants are non-silicon materials added to silicon. N-type dopants provide extra electrons; p-type provide holes [07:53].
	- Deep Level Impurities: Elements with more than one electron off from silicon can degrade electrical properties [09:03].
	- Doping Levels: Doping levels range from lightly doped to degenerate doped [13:22].
	- Doping Methods: Methods include adding dopants to molten silicon, ion implantation, and diffusion [16:21].
	- Dopant Sources for Diffusion: Suitable sources must contain boron or phosphorus and safe atoms [19:51].
