  The video discusses a probability paradox involving a die roll. The paradox involves calculating the expected number of rolls needed to get a six, given that all previous rolls were even numbers. Most people intuitively guess the answer is three, but the correct answer is actually 1.5. The video explains why this is the case, using both intuitive and rigorous arguments. It also explores the common mistakes people make when solving this problem.
