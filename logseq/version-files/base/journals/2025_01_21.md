- Describing Domino Tilings with Prolog
  https://youtu.be/h5Xy4YjCZxM
	- The video is about using Prolog to describe Domino tilings of a chessboard. The speaker starts by explaining the problem of Domino tilings and then introduces the concept of fault-free tilings. He then discusses how to formulate the problem of Domino tilings in Prolog using geometric constraints. He also mentions the use of Boolean variables to represent the placement of Dominoes on the chessboard. Finally, he discusses the trade-off between computation and creativity in Prolog.
