	- 2nd Law of Thermodynamics
		- https://youtu.be/7se7K0mnRaY
		  This video explains the origins of the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy, crediting Rudolf Clausius with developing these ideas:
			- Early theories: In 1850, Clausius built upon the work of Sadi Carnot by theorizing the convertibility of heat and work, introducing the concept of internal energy and publishing a complete version of the first law of thermodynamics [01:29].
			- Opposition and acceptance: Despite initial criticism and accusations of plagiarism from scientists like William Thompson and Hermann Helmholtz, Clausius's work gained recognition over time [03:58].
			- Development of entropy: By 1854, Clausius introduced the concept of "equivalence value," a precursor to entropy, linking it to the direction of heat flow and establishing that the sum of these values in a reversible process is zero [05:05]. He further refined this idea in 1862, relating it to the arrangement of molecules and stating that in a closed system, entropy can only increase [09:09].
			- Formalizing the laws: In 1865, Clausius formalized the second law of thermodynamics, defining entropy (S) and stating that the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum [12:15]. This, along with his statement of the first law, remains a cornerstone of thermodynamics.
			- Later developments: The video also touches on William Thompson's contributions and briefly mentions the later development of Boltzmann's entropy equation [12:30].

		  The video explains the history behind Boltzmann's entropy formula, which relates entropy and the probability of different energy states [00:00].
			- Origin of Entropy: In 1854, Rudolf Clausius introduced the concept of "equivalence value," later termed entropy, and by 1865, he defined the second law of thermodynamics [01:01].
			- Probability in Thermodynamics: Clausius, Maxwell, and Boltzmann contributed to understanding the motion of molecules and its relation to temperature and probability [02:15].
			- Boltzmann's Contribution: Boltzmann explored the relationship between probability and entropy, linking the two concepts [08:15].
			- Max Planck and the Equation: Max Planck introduced the famous equation S = k log W in 1900, linking entropy (S) to the logarithm of probability (W) [15:18]. This equation also led to the birth of quantum mechanics [17:19].
			- Naming and Recognition: Despite Planck creating the equation, it became known as Boltzmann's entropy equation due to Planck's acknowledgment of Boltzmann's earlier work and the trend of naming constants after their discoverers [20:20]. The equation is even inscribed on Boltzmann's grave [22:29].
