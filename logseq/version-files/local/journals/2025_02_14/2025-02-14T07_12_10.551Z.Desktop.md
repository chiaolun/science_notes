  The video is about the physics of pumping a swing. It explains that the common way of pumping a swing, by moving back and forth at the ends of the swing's arc, is not a parametric oscillator, but rather a driven oscillator. This is because the swinger applies force to the swing at the ends of its motion, rather than at the lowest point. The video also shows a demonstration of a driven oscillator using a wheel and a pendulum.
- The video is about the history of physics, focusing on the concept of "living force" (vis viva). The speaker discusses how the concept of living force evolved into the modern understanding of energy. They also discuss the contributions of various scientists, including Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, and Coriolis, to the development of these ideas.
