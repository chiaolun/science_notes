- Preamble
	- Humanity today is in possession of many facts about the physical world. This knowledge allows us great control over the world, allows us to build great machines transforming matter, energy and information in service of our desires. This knowledge was accumulated by our ancestors and passed on to us, and we add to this vast wealth everyday, building the foundation for greater prosperity upon the foundation that was passed to us, layer upon layer.
	- We've learned how to do this better over time, and given name to the body of practice. This is the scientific method and practicing it requires that you be able to imagine ignorance, connect belief to observation, form contingent beliefs (hypotheses) and take actions to resolve that contingency.
	- The actual history of humanity's discoveries is messy and confusing and would take years to disentangle. Fortunately, that is not our task, for skilled storytellers have done the hard work of summarizing it all into a useful abridgment, the textbook that sits in front of you. Over this semester, we will read this story together, and absorb the powers distilled within.
