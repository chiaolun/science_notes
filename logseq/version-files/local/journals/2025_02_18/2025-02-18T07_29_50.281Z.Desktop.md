	- This video is part of a lecture series on orbital mechanics. In this video, the lecturer discusses the Oberth effect, which is a phenomenon that allows spacecraft to gain more kinetic energy from a given amount of fuel when they are closer to a massive body. The lecturer explains the mathematical and physical principles behind the Oberth effect, and provides examples of how it can be used to design more efficient space missions.

	  > The user wants me to parse the text in the image to markdown format.
	  > I need to identify the headings, subheadings, bullet points and apply markdown formatting.
	  > Steps:
	  >  * Identify the main headings. "In this Lecture, you will learn:", "Bi-elliptic Maneuvers", "Out-of-Plane Maneuvers"
	  >  * Identify subheadings or bullet points under "Bi-elliptic Maneuvers":  "3-burn Maneuvers", "Comparison with Hohmann", "Numerical Example", "Elliptic", "Circular"
	  >  * Identify subheadings or bullet points under "Out-of-Plane Maneuvers": "Inclination Change", "Right Ascension Change"
	  >  * Apply markdown formatting.
	  >    * Headings: ##
	  >    * Bullet points: -
	  >    * Sub-bullet points (if any, based on indentation, will use deeper indentation in markdown)
	  > Let's look at the image structure again.
	  > "In this Lecture, you will learn:" - seems like a main title/introduction. Let's make it bold, or maybe H2.
	  > "Bi-elliptic Maneuvers" and "Out-of-Plane Maneuvers" - are main sections, H2 seems good.
	  > The lines starting with bullets (â€¢) are clearly bullet points under "Bi-elliptic Maneuvers" and "Out-of-Plane Maneuvers".
	  > The "Elliptic" and "Circular" under "Numerical Example" seem to be sub-bullets under "Numerical Example". Let's make them indented bullet points.
	  > Let's try to format in markdown now:
