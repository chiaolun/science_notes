	- This video is part of a lecture series on orbital mechanics. In this video, the lecturer discusses the Oberth effect, which is a phenomenon that allows spacecraft to gain more kinetic energy from a given amount of fuel when they are closer to a massive body. The lecturer explains the mathematical and physical principles behind the Oberth effect, and provides examples of how it can be used to design more efficient space missions.
